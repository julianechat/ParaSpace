\description{
A rootogram is a model diagnostic tool that assesses the goodness of fit of
a statistical model. The observed values of the response are compared with
those expected from the fitted model. For discrete, count responses, the
frequency of each count (0, 1, 2, etc) in the observed data and expected
from the conditional distribution of the response implied by the model are
compared. For continuous variables, the observed and expected frequencies
are obtained by grouping the data into bins. The rootogram is drawn using
\code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot2::ggplot()}} graphics. The design closely follows Kleiber & Zeileis
(2016).

\examples{
load_mgcv()
df <- data_sim("eg1", n = 1000, dist = "poisson", scale = 0.1, seed = 6)

# A poisson example
m <- gam(y ~ s(x0, bs = "cr") + s(x1, bs = "cr") + s(x2, bs = "cr") +
         s(x3, bs = "cr"), family = poisson(), data = df, method = "REML")
rg <- rootogram(m)

# plot the rootogram
draw(rg)

# change the type of rootogram
draw(rg, type = "suspended")
